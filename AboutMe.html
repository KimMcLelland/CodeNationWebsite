        <p>I have been a fan of metal music since my teenage years in the late 80s and early 90s.  My tastes have expanded
            over the years to encompass a broad range of music styles, but I keep coming back to metal as nothing quite  matches
            the intensity, power and depth of that music.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>My interest in coding goes back to the same time, or slightly earlier, as my first experiments with programming 
            were on the BBC Micro using Basic.  Some of my first computer games were on the BBC Micro and I was fond of 
            trying to alter the code so that it would print different text on the screen for example.  I also experimented 
            with coding a program that used time and random numbers to print different text in a loop on the screen.
            Over the years I have never been far away from a computer, even though for a long time
            I was simply using Word Processors for writing my fantasy fiction stories, rather than doing any coding.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>In the early 00s I studied philosophy as an undergraduate, a discipline that I think is invaluable when
            it comes to learning some of the logic applied in back end coding.  It was when studying for my Masters in Multimedia Journalism from 2016-2018 that I was introduced to HTML and CSS.
            I was excited to be using the language used to design websites and I started to get a sense that it might make
            more sense to start a career in coding than in the unreliable, self-promoting world of journalism.  My creative flair 
            could be used in web design after all.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>I learnt more coding on codecademy, including some Javascript.  I was excited to learn a more back end language
            because I could instantly see its potential for programming games, something I was developing quite an interest in thanks
            to Open World games such as Skyrim and Minecraft.  By this time I was determined that I wanted a career in coding and to use
            my creative skills to code computer games in my spare time too.  So I studied with CodeNation with an eye  to becoming
            a professional coder, which is when I discovered the programming language that put a massive smile on my face: Python.

        <p>I had a lot of fun creating this website - <strong>I hope you like it!</strong> 
            I generally like my website, both in style and in content.  I think the main page looks great.  
            Although I generally like the styling I did for my About Me page, I find the Contacts page looks a 
            little too plain.  I didnâ€™t think it would make sense for those two  pages to  have the same background image 
            as the main page, as they are not actually about heavy metal, but the lack of a cohesive look across 
            all the pages does bother me slightly.  Maybe with more time I will come up with a solution to this stylistic challenge.</p>
